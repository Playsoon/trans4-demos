# TK4 Tutorials & Demos

This repository contains examples of how to script the new Trans4 engine. Trans4 relies on the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/). If you are new to Lua or the TK, it is recommended you follow this order:

1. [Game State Example](https://github.com/rpgtoolkit/trans4-demos/tree/master/GameStatesExample) - Teaches the basics of how the engine works and what it expects from its Lua scripts
2. [Shape Drawing Example](https://github.com/rpgtoolkit/trans4-demos/tree/master/ShapeDrawingExample) - Teaches you how to draw basic shapes like rectangles and lines.
3. [Texture Drawing Example](https://github.com/rpgtoolkit/trans4-demos/tree/master/TextureDrawingExample) - Teaches you the proper way to load and draw an image.
4. [Clip Drawing Example](https://github.com/rpgtoolkit/trans4-demos/tree/master/ClipDrawingExample) - Teaches you how to draw a portion of an image.
5. [Canvas Drawing Example](https://github.com/rpgtoolkit/trans4-demos/tree/master/CanvasDrawingExample) - Shows canvas functionality similar to what was offered in TK3.
